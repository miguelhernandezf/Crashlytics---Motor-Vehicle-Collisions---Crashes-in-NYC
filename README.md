### üìö About Data  
---

The Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset contains detailed information on motor vehicle collisions reported in New York City (NYC). Each record represents a unique crash event, providing essential details such as the date, time, location, and the number of individuals involved and injured or killed. The dataset also includes contributing factors to the crash, as well as information about the types of vehicles involved.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Data Wrangling  
---

Conducted simple data wrangling and data cleaning:

- Removed rows with missing values  
- Excluded rows with "Unknown" funding values  
- Filtered the dataset to include only recent years to improve performance and focus on more relevant, modern crash trends  
- Worked with the `CRASH DATE` and `CRASH TIME` columns to extract temporal features such as year, month, weekday, and hour for deeper time-based analysis

### üí° Recommendations
---
 
- This report enables stakeholders to identify which day of the week has the highest frequency of motor vehicle collisions, supporting more informed decision-making around resource allocation, public safety campaigns, or policy adjustments.
- Identifying Peak Collision Days: This report helps identify the day of the week with the highest frequency of collisions. Focus awareness campaigns and enforcement on peak days to reduce accidents.

- Yearly Crash Trends: Data can be filtered by year to analyze trends. Use this data to allocate resources effectively, especially during high-crash periods.

- Vehicle Type Insights: The dashboard allows filtering by vehicle type. Introduce targeted safety measures for vehicle types with higher collision rates.

- Geographic Analysis by Borough: Collisions can be analyzed by borough, supporting localized decisions. Direct resources to high-collision boroughs and evaluate infrastructure improvements in those areas.

- Interactive Map for Risk Zones: The map visualizes crash locations and risk zones. Review high-risk areas and collaborate with city planners to improve safety measures at critical intersections.
